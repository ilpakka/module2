            I met a traveller from an antique land<br>
            Who said: Two vast and trunkless legs of stone<br>
            Stand in the desart. Near them, on the sand,<br> <!--- 18th century spelling of the word desert -->
            Half sunk, a shattered visage lies, whose frown,<br>
            And wrinkled lip, and sneer of cold command,<br>
            Tell that its sculptor well those passions read<br>
            Which yet survive, stamped on these lifeless things<br>
            The hand that mocked them, and the heart that fed;<br>
            And on the pedestal, these words appear:<br>
            "My name is OZYMANDIAS, King of Kings;<br>
            Look on my Works, ye Mighty, and despair!"<br>
            Nothing beside remains. Round the decay<br>
            Of that colossal Wreck, boundless and bare<br>
            The lone and level sands stretch far away.<br>
